<h4>1. INTRODUCTION TO ROOFADVISORZ</h4>

<p>Upon registration, you may choose your own password or RoofAdvisorZ will assign you a password to access the Services through the RoofAdvisorZ website or mobile apps.</p>



<h4>2. THE SERVICES</h4>

<p>RoofAdvisorZ is committed to making your total RoofAdvisorZ experience a positive one. There are several ways you can find service professionals through RoofAdvisorZ (collectively, "Service Professionals"). Our Emergency Repair Service allows you to request on demand same day service emergency roof repair via our mobile applications and our web application. Our Schedule Service Repair is our service where you request a service professional for a specific future scheduled day, and where you choose the service professional or where the service professional accepts the scheduled time you requested. You will be able to view all Service Professionalâ€™s ratings and reviews.	

</p>

<ol type="1">

<li><b>Emergency Repair Service.</b> Upon entering your information and the request for which you would like a Service Professional, Service Professionals will accept your request for emergency service repair and provide you with an ETA. You will be able to track their service vehicle real time via our mobile application. However, we do not guarantee that a service professional will be able to immediately match your service needs due to high demand in your area or that there are Service Professionals in your area that are either capable or willing to complete your service needs.

</li>

<li><b>Scheduled Repair Services. </b> You can choose to schedule appointments with certain Service Professionals right in the RoofAdvisorZ website or mobile application. Please be aware that RoofAdvisorZ does not guarantee that the Service Professionals will be on time for, or show up for, any such booked appointments, as the Service Professionals are not the employees, contractors or agents of RoofAdvisorZ. RoofAdvisorZ is solely providing the platform to facilitate scheduling of appointments between you and the Service Professionals.	

</li>

<li><b>No Guarantees or Endorsements.</b>Although we take certain steps to examine the credentials of the Service Professionals listed on our website or whom you may book using our Services, we make no guarantees, warranties or representations regarding the skills or undertakings of such Service Professional or the quality of the job that he or she may perform for you if you elect to retain their services. RoofAdvisorZ does not endorse or recommend the services of any particular Service Professional. Except as set forth below in Paragraph 11 and Paragraph 12, we do not independently verify their representations about their services, nor validate any reviews. It is entirely up to you to evaluate the Service Professional and the Service Professional's qualifications, and to enter into a direct contract or otherwise reach agreement with a Service Professional. We do not guarantee or warrant any Service Professional's performance on the job or the outcome or quality of the services performed. The Service Professionals are not employees or agents of RoofAdvisorZ, nor is RoofAdvisorZ an agent of the Service Professionals.</li>

<li><b>No Contracting via the RoofAdvisorZ Website.</b> RoofAdvisorZ may inform you of certain offers or discounts provided by a Service Professional. Such offers or discounts are made solely by the Service Professional, and RoofAdvisorZ does not guarantee or warrant the pricing or discounts that a Service Professional may offer you. Any quotes provided by Service Professionals via the RoofAdvisorZ or apps, or which you find on the RoofAdvisorZ or apps, are not contractually binding offers, are for informational purposes only, and cannot be accepted on or via RoofAdvisorZ. No contractual arrangement is created based upon the quotes provided to you from Service Professionals (or your scheduling of an appointment with a Service Professional) via RoofAdvisorZ. To contract with a Service Professional, you must work directly with the Service Professional. RoofAdvisorZ does not perform, and is not responsible for, any of the Services requested by you in your service request. Your rights under contracts you enter into with Service Professionals are governed by the terms of such contracts and by applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. RoofAdvisorZ is not a party to such agreements. All payments and applicable taxes must be made to the Service Professional in accordance with the agreements.</li>



<li><b>Release from Damages or Claims.</b> Should you have a dispute with respect to any services provided by a Service Professional or the fees charged by any Service Professional, you must address such dispute with the Service Professional directly (although you may copy RoofAdvisorZ on the fee disputes). YOU HEREBY AGREE TO RELEASE RoofAdvisorZ (AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) FROM ANY DAMAGES OR CLAIMS (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES) OF EVERY KIND OR NATURE, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, AND DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES AND YOUR DEALINGS WITH SERVICE PROFESSIONALS.</li>

</ul>

</ol>

You acknowledge that a violation of the foregoing could result in significant damages, and you agree that you are liable to RoofAdvisorZ for any such damages, and will indemnify RoofAdvisorZ in the event of any claims against RoofAdvisorZ based on or arising from your violation of the foregoing. We reserve the right to revoke your access to any RoofAdvisorZ Services, products or properties at any time. All information about Service Professionals is confidential and for your personal use only.

</p>

<h4>4. PAYMENTS</h4>

Should you have any dispute with the goods or services provided by the Service Professional(s) you select, as set forth in in Section 2, #7, you must contact the Service Professional and resolve such dispute with the Service Professional. However, if the dispute is regarding the amount of money that you paid for the services by the Service Professional (including that you were not charged the amount you agreed to in your agreement with the Service Professional) please advise us immediately. If we have not heard from you with documented proof of any issues provided within ten (10) days after the payment has been made for the Service Professional services, the purchase of the services is final and you will not be entitled to a refund, except as may expressly be limited by Federal, state or local law.</p>



<h4>5. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US/TCPA CONSENT</h4>

<p>

Upon using RoofAdvisorZ, you will be prompted to disclose certain information about yourself and your service requirements, and you will be able to store information, such as home services records, on our website or apps. Some of this information will be sent to Service Professionals who will need this information to respond to your request. By providing this information to us, or by submitting a service request, you are requesting, and you expressly consent to being contacted by us and by our Service Professionals via phone, fax, email, mail, text (SMS) messaging, or other reasonable means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, even if you are listed on any federal, state, provincial or other applicable "Do Not Call" list, in order that we may provide the Services set forth on our site, to service your account, to reasonably address matters pertaining to your account, including but not limited to notifying you of, or confirming, appointments that you have scheduled, or for other purposes reasonably related to your service request and our business, including marketing related emails. You also authorize RoofAdvisorZ to send you an automated prerecorded call confirming your service request, along with calls from up to four service professionals that can help you with your request to the land-line or mobile phone number you provided, and you understand that either RoofAdvisorZ or the Service Professionals may use automated phone technology (including autodialed and prerecorded messages) to call you and that your consent is not required to purchase products or services. For complete details on our use of your information, please see our privacy statement. You agree that by completing a service request, you are entering into a business relationship with RoofAdvisorZ and/or a Service Professional and thus agree to be contacted by RoofAdvisorZ and/or a Service Professional. You promise that all information you provide (including but not limited to your contact information, and any Ratings and Reviews of Service Professionals that you provide) will be accurate, current and truthful to the best of your knowledge. If you provide any information that is untrue, not current or incomplete, or RoofAdvisorZ has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, RoofAdvisorZ has the right to refuse any current or future use of the RoofAdvisorZ Services (or any portion thereof) by you. You are responsible for any use of the RoofAdvisorZ Services by persons to whom you intentionally or negligently allow access to your password.

<br>

TO KNOWINGLY INPUT FALSE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NAME, PHONE NUMBER, ADDRESS OR E-MAIL ADDRESS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND FRAUDULENT MATTER THAT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND DAMAGES INCLUDING INVASION OF PRIVACY RIGHTS, TO RoofAdvisorZ AND THE SERVICE PROFESSIONALS, AND TO CONSUMERS, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF TIME, EFFORT AND EXPENSE RESPONDING TO AND PURSUING SUCH FALSE INFORMATION AND REQUEST, AND FURTHER, COULD RESULT IN REGULATORY FINES AND PENALTIES. ACCORDINGLY, IF YOU KNOWINGLY INPUT FALSE INFORMATION IN A SERVICE REQUEST, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SOME ONE ELSE'S NAME, E-MAIL ADDRESS, PHYSICAL ADDRESS OR PHONE NUMBER OR A RANDOM OR MADE UP NAME, ADDRESS, E-MAIL OR PHONE NUMBER YOU AGREE TO FULLY INDEMNIFY AND BE LIABLE TO RoofAdvisorZ AND EACH SERVICE PROVIDER WHO ACCEPTS SUCH SERVICE REQUESTS, FOR THE GREATER OF: (1) A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF $11,000 TO EACH OF RoofAdvisorZ AND EACH OF THE AFFECTED SERVICE PROFESSIONALS AND FOR EACH OF THE ACTUAL PERSON(S) AFFECTED BY ANY OF THE IMPROPER, INCORRECT OR FRAUDULENT INFORMATION YOU ENTER (FOR EXAMPLE THE ACTUAL OWNER OF THE E-MAIL ADDRESS OR PHONE NUMBER, ETC.), PER IMPROPER SUBMISSION, PLUS ANY ATTORNEYS FEES COSTS AND EXPENSE RELATING THERETO, IF APPLICABLE, OR (2) THE ACTUAL DAMAGES, DIRECT, PUNITIVE AND CONSEQUENTIAL, AND ANY REGULATORY OR JUDICIAL FINES OR PENALTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH INTENTIONAL, MISLEADING, HARMFUL AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY, PLUS REASONABLE LEGAL FEES, COST AND EXPENSES RELATING THERETO, WHICH EVER IS GREATER.

</p>





<h4>6. SMS MESSAGING</h4>

<p>

By submitting a service request, you agree that RoofAdvisorZ and the Service Professionals may send you informational text (SMS) messages as part of the normal business practice of RoofAdvisorZ. These text (SMS) messages shall not be used for marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of receiving text (SMS) messages from RoofAdvisorZ at any time by texting the word STOP to 89056 from the mobile device that is receiving the messages. You acknowledge that by opting out of receiving text (SMS) messages from RoofAdvisorZ and the Service Professionals, your use of RoofAdvisorZ Services may be impacted.

</p>



<h4>7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION ASSISTANCE</h4>

<p>

While we cannot guarantee the work performed by a listed Service Professional, and while we have no obligation to you with regard to your relationship with a Service Professional, the RoofAdvisorZ resolution process has been developed to try and assist you in resolving any disputes that may arise in the course of a home improvement repair or maintenance project with a Service Professional who you learned about through the RoofAdvisorZ Services. Without modifying our statements under this Agreement, we may, upon your request, provide limited assistance in resolving disputes between you and a Service Professional. You must participate and use good faith efforts to resolve problems through the RoofAdvisorZ resolution process. Such limited assistance in no way nullifies the release and indemnification described in these Terms & Conditions.

<h4>10. SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE SCREENING PROCEDURES AND DISCLAIMERS</h4>

<p>Unless otherwise noted on the screening tab of a Service Professional's profile page, RoofAdvisorZ.com uses the following criteria as part of its registration enrollment process ("registration") for new Service Professionals, with the exception of Corporate Accounts (as described below) and service professionals providing services in Canada (neither of which are screened) applying for membership in our network:

</p>

<ol type="a">

<li><b>Licensing</b> - We confirm at the time of a service professional's application, that a prospective new SP member has all applicable required state-level trade licensing for the services for which we match them to consumers. Certain states may require state-level licensing for projects above specified dollar amounts. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements with the business and the applicable state and local licensing authorities. In some states, licensing may be required by the county or local authority in which the work is being performed. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding with your project. Larger projects often require the use of sub-contractors for specific types of work (for example, a kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We recommend you verify that all the sub-contractors doing work on your project carry the appropriate licensing. Given the unique nature of California licensing, RoofAdvisorZ relies on representations of service professionals that are using a California General building contracting license to cover home improvement tasks that such service professionals are performing more than one task as defined and required by California licensing rules. We always recommend that you ask the business to provide you with a copy of their license.

</li>

<li><b>State Business Filings</b> - For service professionals that are corporations or limited liability companies, we confirm that the business is registered in the state in which it is located.

</li>

<li><b>Criminal Records Search </b>- We use third party data sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business, within the three years prior to such service professional's application for membership in the RoofAdvisorZ network. RoofAdvisorZ?s third-party vendor uses a national criminal database ("NCD") to screen our service professionals. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, and WY. For more information, click on the "Instant Database Searches" tab on the following webpage: http://www.backgroundchecks.com/ourdata/coveragemap.

</li>

<li>

<b>Sex Offender Search </b>- We check the websites that consolidate state sex offender information in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match based solely on the name of the owner/principal of the company. We do not run sex offender searches in any other states. Please note that only a fingerprint match can guarantee an accurate match for a sex offender search. We recommend that you check the applicable state sex offender websites for any individuals that will be performing work in your home.

</li>

<li>

<b>Identity Verification (Social Security Number)</b> - RoofAdvisorZ verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)

</li>



<li><b>Legal Search for Civil Judgments </b>- We use third party data sources to check, within the 12 months prior to the service professional?s application for membership in the RoofAdvisorZ network, for significant state-level civil legal judgments or liens entered against the owner/principal by business customers and for bankruptcy filings by or against the owner/principal, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located.<br>

WE PERFORM THE ABOVE SCREENING BASED UPON INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL (E.G. NAME OF OWNER, BIRTHDATE, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER)

<br>

NOTE: ROOFADVISORZ PERFORMS SCREENING SOLELY AT THE TIME THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL APPLIES FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE ROOFADVISORZ NETWORK, AND THEREFORE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S INFORMATION MAY CHANGE OR EXPIRE OVER TIME. THUS, ROOFADVISORZ CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT PROFILE AND SCREENING INFORMATION IS UP TO DATE. ROOFADVISORZ IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S SCREENING INFORMATION. WE RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE WORKING WITH A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL YOU VERIFY THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S PROFILE IS STILL ACCURATE, CURRENT AND ACCEPTABLE TO YOU.

<br>

Corporate Accounts: Some Service Professionals are employees, franchisees, dealers, or independent contractors ("Corporate SP's") of larger national or corporate accounts ("Corporate Accounts"). In such event, you may be matched with the Corporate Account entity or with one of their Corporate SP's. The above screening criteria is not applicable to Corporate Accounts, and therefore, RoofAdvisorZ does not screen the Corporate Accounts or Corporate SP's.

<br>

Service Professionals Profiles: RoofAdvisorZ allows Service Professionals to post profiles about themselves and their business on the RoofAdvisorZ or apps. RoofAdvisorZ does not review or verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles, except as expressly set forth above, as they are self-reported by the Service Professional. RoofAdvisorZ therefore makes no representations or warranties regarding any information posted by a Service Professional, and assumes no liability for such information.

<br>

The above procedures may change from time to time at the sole discretion of RoofAdvisorZ. RoofAdvisorZ believes that it uses commercially reasonable methods to check these matters but does not make any representations or warranties that members continue to meet the above screening criteria after the date of their enrollment in the RoofAdvisorZ network. RoofAdvisorZ does not represent or warrant that the information received from state, provincial or other government agencies or from third party sources is accurate, error free, or that it is up to date or updated at the time that RoofAdvisorZ checks such information. Most agencies have periodic update cycles or schedules and this information is not updated on a real-time basis by such agencies and third party sources.

<br>

DISCLAIMER: ROOFADVISORZ EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED RELATING TO THE SCREENING PROCESS, CRITERIA, PROCEDURES, OR INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PRESENTED IN THE SCREENING PROCESS OR DISCLOSURES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES OR STANDARDS ARE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IN THESE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IS ACCURATE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE.

<br>

</li>

</ol>



<h4>11. AFFILIATE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE-SCREENING. </h4>

<p>

While we will not match you with a service professional from our affiliates, we may display to you service professionals from affiliates, including but not limited to Angie's List. These service professionals have NOT been screened by RoofAdvisorZ using the screening set forth in Section 11. Rather, these service professionals have been screened as follows:<br>

RoofAdvisorZ will only display Angie's List Service professionals that

</p>



<ol type="a">

<li>Have an Overall "A" or "B: rating from member reviews;</li>

<li>Have passed all background checks established by Angie's List (as described below);</li>

<li>Attest that they possess all applicable state and local licensing, registration, or other trade requirements to provide service for the Project or the project described in the Lead; and</li>

<li>Are in good business standing with Angie's List

<p>

Angie's List has criminal background checks performed annually on the principal/owner or relevant manager of all "A"- and "B"-rated companies that are Certified Service Providers, that offer ecommerce offers, that receive leads through the Projects Submissions platform, or that are granted the Super Service Award. The background check currently is performed by American Business Services ("ABS"), a third-party screening company. Upon processing the background check, ABS will provide Angie's List with a simple "pass" or "fail" designation. A failed background check is one that finds one or more of the following: (1) any violent or theft conviction at a felony level in the last 7 years; (2) any sexual felony conviction or on a sexual offender registry at any time (no time limit); or (3) any pending felony charges involving any of types (1) or (2).</p>

<p>

ABS will provide Angie's List with only a pass or fail designation. Angie's List and its members will never see any content from background check results. Since Angieâ€™s can only perform these background checks annually, we ask anyone with knowledge of legal, ethical or financial concerns regarding a company contact us by either logging in and selecting Send A Message using our contact form. While we always strive to provide the most current information, we also recommend that you perform your own research on the companies you hire.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h4>12. RATINGS & REVIEWS ARE NOT ENDORSED BY ROOFADVISORZ.COM</h4>

<h4>16. ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW </h4>

<ol type="a">

<li>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute between you and RoofAdvisorZ or any claim made by you or RoofAdvisorZ arising out of or relating to your use of this Website and/or RoofAdvisorZ's services (including any alleged breach of these Terms and Conditions) shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against RoofAdvisorZ in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction OR EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE LAW. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against RoofAdvisorZ any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</li>

</ol>

<h4>17. NOTICE OF RIGHTS </h4>

<ol type="a">

<li>By using the Website and/or RoofAdvisorZ's services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and RoofAdvisorZ (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.

</li>

<li>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration provision, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration provision is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against RoofAdvisorZ (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Denver County, Colorado. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.

</li>

<li>These Terms and Conditions, and any dispute between you and RoofAdvisorZ, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Colorado without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

</li>

</ol>		



<h4>18. GENERAL PROVISIONS </h4>

<p>

You acknowledge and agree that the RoofAdvisorZ Services are provided to you on an "AS IS" basis without any warranty whatsoever, and your sole and exclusive remedy, and RoofAdvisorZ's sole obligation to you or any third party for any claim arising out of your use of the RoofAdvisorZ Services or the RoofAdvisorZ or apps, is that you are free to discontinue your use of the RoofAdvisorZ Services or the RoofAdvisorZ or apps at any time. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, RoofAdvisorZ EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT RoofAdvisorZ SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFIT), EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (EVEN IF RoofAdvisorZ HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONSEQUENCES WHICH FLOW FROM IT. SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON OR EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN SUCH STATES AND PROVINCES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. The Terms and Conditions will inure to the benefit of RoofAdvisorZ's successors, assigns and licensees. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, for any reason, by any court of competent jurisdiction that provision shall be modified in order to make it enforceable, while maintaining the spirit of the provision. Alternatively, if modification is not possible, such provision shall be stricken and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms. The failure of RoofAdvisorZ to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms and Conditions must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely in the State of Colorado and between Colorado residents. You agree to submit to jurisdiction in Colorado and that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions will be brought solely in a court in Denver County, Colorado. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and RoofAdvisorZ and supersede all oral and written negotiations or representations of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and Conditions may not be modified or amended other than by an agreement signed by both parties.
